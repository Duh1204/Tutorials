1: You wake up in a dark foul smelling alley. Fragmentary images flash through your mind. One is of a person who is richly dressed, walking off a boat. She is looking for someone. As she passes through a narrow passage someone attacks her. The world fades to black.

2: Your head hurts. You reach up and, tentatively, feel the back of your skull. You feel a lump and, when you look at your fingers, they are smeared with blood. Your clothes would have fetched a fair amount of gold were they new but they are now ripped and dirty.

3: There is a dim light at the end of the narrow alley. Looking up you see a carriage rattle by. “Only a few more footsteps,” you whisper to yourself. “You can do this.”
