choice_1: You say, "I hope you're okay with disappointment."
choice_2: You say, "I don't have 100 gold but I'll play along. What would you give me in return?"
choice_3: You say, "Good to know," and move on.
response_1: The figure scowls at you. "Begone then, but know that those you love will pay for your carelessness."
response_2: The figure says, "People call me Westley. I hear you have lost your memory. I can help you out, tell you why you're here. Trust me, you'll want to know. Those you love depend on you."
response_3: The figure growls at you and turns away.

prompt: Westley says, "Before you say anything, know that I can prove I am who I am." Westley produces a sealed note. The seal has been stamped with a crest that seems familiar to you.
choice_1: You say, "Where did you get that?"
choice_2: You say, "That seal... it seems familiar. Whose seal is it?"
choice_3: You say, "I've changed my mind, goodbye."
response_1: Westley says, "Pay me 100 gold and I'll tell you that and much more."
response_2: Westley says, "Pay me 100 gold and I'll tell you that and much more."

prompt: Westley says, "So? What do you say? Do I get 100 gold?"
choice_1: You wrestle with yourself. It is a LOT of money, more than you have, but something inside tells you that this shadowy figure could be telling you the truth. "Okay. We have a deal." As you shake hands he gives you a toothy grin.
choice_2: You say, "No. No. I don't have 100 gold but even if I did I have no reason to trust you."
choice_3: You say, "I'm not sure. I'll need to think about it."
response_1: Westley nods. "Good choice. When you get the money return here, I'll find you. But don't take too long, I have enemies and cannot tarry."
response_2: Westley scowls at you. "If you change your mind you know where to find me."
response_3: Westley scowls at you. "Suit yourself. You know where to find me."
