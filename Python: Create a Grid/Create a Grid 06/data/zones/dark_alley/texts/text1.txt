1: You wake up in a dark foul smelling alley. Fragmentary images flash through her mind. You dream of a person who is richly dressed. This person is walking off a boat, looking for someone. After passing through a narrow passage this person is ambushed. The world fades to black.

2: Were those memories? You feel an urgency to travel somewhere, an’t remember where. You reach up and, tentatively, feel the back of your head. You feel a bump and sticky wetness. Your fingers are smeared with blood. Your clothes--which would have fetched a fair amount of gold were they new--are ripped and dirty.

3: You notice a dim light at the end of the narrow alley that you are in. Dazed, you look around and wonder how you got here. Staggering to your feet you gingerly touch your long black hair. When you take it away it’s covered in blood. The sight makes you lightheaded and you stagger. To prevent yourself from falling you reach out and steady yourself against the grungy brick wall. Looking up you see a carriage rattle by.

4: “Only a few more footsteps,” you whisper to yourself. “You can do this.”

5: Your head feels as though your skull is fractured and the parts want to slide away from each other. A metallic taste fills your mouth. Bending down, you retch.
