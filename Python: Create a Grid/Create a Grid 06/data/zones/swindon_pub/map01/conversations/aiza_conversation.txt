prompt: Aiza says, "The raccoons never bothered us before. Something has obviously changed. Find out what changed AND CHANGE IT BACK!!!!"
choice_1: You say, "Ah. Okay. When you put it like that it seems pretty simple."
choice_2: You say, "I'm new to these parts, is there anyone who might be able to give me an idea of what changed?"
choice_3: You say, "You don't have to yell!"
response_1: Aiza says, "That's because it IS simple!" She visibly tries to calm down. "I'm sorry, it's just that I'm SO TIRED of being attacked. Why don't you talk to the owner of The Salty Spoon in Easthaven? That's where the raccoons are from, he might know something."
response_2: Aiza says, "Why don't you talk to the owner of The Salty Spoon in Easthaven? Easthaven is where the raccoons are from. His name is Artifix. He seems to know EVERYTHING, so he might know something about what drove the raccoons away."
response_3: Aiza says, "Really! REALLY!! Oh well, maybe not. Just do us all a favor and go talk to Artifix over at The Salty Spoon in Easthaven. He's the own and seems to know just about everything.

choice_1: You scratch your chin. "Okay. Normally I'd try and haggle but I guess this is an emergency. I'll do what I can."
choice_2: You say, "Okay. I'll do what I can."
choice_3: You say, "No. Sorry. I'm not interested. I have worries of my own."

response_2: Azia smiles. "Thank you. I didn't think you would come through for us. I'm sorry for underestimating you."
