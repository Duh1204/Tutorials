prompt: I have two items. You may choose one of them. The first is a potion that will, if drunk, restore 10 health points. The other item is a large red ruby that is worth a king's ransom. Which would you like me to give you?

choice_2: After some consideration you choose the ruby.
choice_3: Neither.

response_2: The figure smirks. "Of course. So predictable." You have been dismissed.

prompt: Well, go on then.
choice_1: Puzzled by his attitude, you nod to the figure.
choice_2: You say, sarcasm dripping off your words, "Thank you for all your help."

response_2: The figure is still for a moment and then says, "May you get everything you deserve."
response_3: The figure flinches. "That's a long story, and one I have no inclination to recount. Especially to you."
