prompt: Halt! You there! I don’t recognize you. State your business.
choice_1: You say, "None of your business!"
choice_2: A wave of anger washes through you but quickly dies when you notice the man’s hands are shaking. "I'm not sure," you say, "it's ... Well, it has been a rough day."
choice_3: "Oh, fine! Just fine," you say.
response_1: "Fine! Begone!!" the lamplighter says. He begins to mumble in a language that seems vaguely familiar. Moments later you find it difficult to breathe. Gasping, you fall to the floor, dead.
response_2: You open your mouth to tell the man your name but your mind is blank. You do not know your own name! Childhood? Blank. Parents? Blank. Friends? Blank. Family? Blank. Now it is your turn to tremble. You explain your situation to the lamplighter.
response_3: I detect falsehood. Begone!

prompt: “Well …” he says and looks at you intently while thoughtfully massaging his chin. “Your clothes are dirty and torn but the material is of good quality--silk if I don’t mistake--and embroidered. Someone spent many hours creating that dress for you. And that right there …” He points to a crest embroidered into the silk over your heart. “If my eyes don’t fail me, that’s a crest of some kind. You might be the child of a rich merchant or perhaps even a noble. You should find out. They'll be looking for you.”
