prompt: Tyla says, "The feathers are rare. They come from birds that fly along the cliffs. It's dangerous work and the raccoons will attack you if you try to leave the town."
choice_1: You say, "Well, okay. I'm not greedy, but ... how much are you willing to pay for a feather from one of these birds?"
choice_2: You say, "Okay. That sounds interesting. But I'm new here, I'm not sure I would know where to go. Perhaps I'll come back later.."
choice_3: You say, "Raccoons! Oh, no. I'm not tangling with those raccoons again. Get your feathers yourself."
response_1: Tyla says, "Oh, of course! I will pay you well. 40 gold for three feathers."
response_2: Tyla nods, "With pleasure!"
response_3: Tyla nods, "Okay. I can't say I'm not disappointed, but I understand. Go in peace."
