prompt: Hi! My name is Bertron. Welcome to Swindon. Business has been slow lately because of those blasted raccoons so I don't have anything to sell at the present. Anyway. If you have jewelry or, perhaps, a gem you'd like to sell, I'll take a look.
choice_1: You say, "Thanks, but I just came in to say hello."
choice_2: You say, "Okay. As it happens I have a couple of things I'd like to show you."
choice_3: You say, "As you've noticed, I need gold. Do you know where I could find work?"
response_1: Bertron nodds.
response_2: Bertron says, "As you like. Let's see them."
response_3: Bertron says, "Check with Tyla the healer or Aiza the baker. Tyla works out of Alfred's Goods and Aiza is usually in the local pub, The Fiery Cauldron."

prompt: Bertron says, "Show me what you've got."
choice_1: You yawn, "Tired now. I'll be going."
choice_2: You say, "I'd like to sell this red amulet I found."
choice_3: You say, "I'd be interested in what you can tell me about this gold ring."
response_1: Bertron scowls at you.
response_2: Bertron examines the red amulet. "Hummm. Unusual. I'll pay you 20 gold for it."
response_3: Bertron examines the gold ring. "Why are you trying to sell me this piece of rubbish? Take it to Hector in Easthaven; that piece of garbage looks nearly as old as he is so perhaps he'll want it."

prompt: Bertron gazes at you for a long moment. "I've heard about you. We don't get many newcomers here. Not to put too fine a point on it, business has been slow. If you were to give me 10 gold I could tell you something more about that gold ring of yours."
choice_1: You scowl at Bertron. "So that's the way of it? All right, here you go. Have your 10 gold. But this had best be worth the coin."
choice_2: You say, "10 gold! No thank you. I'll find out whatever I need to on my own."
choice_3: You say, "Let me think about it."
response_1: Bertron nods.
response_2: Bertron scowls at you.
response_3: Bertron nods.
